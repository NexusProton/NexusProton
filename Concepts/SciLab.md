**Game Description for *Scilab* (Scientific Labyrinth)**

In a distant future, humanity is on the verge of a monumental breakthrough—a new planet has been discovered, perfect for colonization. As part of the vanguard team, *you* are tasked with overseeing the development of human-like avatars, the key to sustaining life on this alien world. But just as the first wave of terraforming begins, disaster strikes.

A hostile civilization has sabotaged the project, sending waves of menacing GhostShips to hunt down and destroy the avatars before they can even take their first breath. These relentless enemies lurk within the labyrinthine corridors of the planet’s treacherous terrain, hiding in the shadows, ready to ambush.

Now, it’s up to *you* to defend humanity’s future. Navigate through a maze of towering walls, evade deadly GhostShips, and collect vital resources—ammunition, fuel, repair kits, and advanced weaponry. Every choice you make will decide the fate of the colonization mission. Can you outsmart the enemy, safeguard the avatars, and claim the planet for humanity?

Experience the thrill of aerial combat, intense ship-to-ship battles, and strategic planning. And in the multiplayer mode, join forces or compete against other players to determine who will truly save—or sabotage—the future of mankind.

The future of humanity rests in *your* hands.
